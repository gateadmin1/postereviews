            <p class="card-text">I had to pay a lot of money to other shipping companies before I discovered CIFgate in order to transport 50 kilos from Sierra Leone to Canada.
              I was first exposed to CIFgate by a CIF buyer, and I used the service to send a test shipment of 5 kilograms from Liberia 
              to California. Because of my previous experience, I was first skeptical when the agent requested me to pay $175 in order to register. I never wanted to pay.
              I thought I would give them a shot, and to my surprise, four days later, I got a phone telling me to meet the agents at the airport.
              For those seeking a shipper who can ship quickly and securely, CIfgate is an excellent choice.</p>

            <p class="card-text">When I first visited the website, I signed up and used their service once, but after two weeks, everything stopped working. 
              There was nothing online concerning CIFgate that I could find. Do you know what happened and why they stopped using the internet?
